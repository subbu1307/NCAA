# NCAA Bracket Prediction: Fan Behavior Analysis

This project explores behavioral trends in NCAA March Madness bracket predictions, with a focus on regional bias and irrational fan decision-making. Submitted as part of a statewide analytics competition, this work earned 3rd place across Indiana.

## Problem Statement

March Madness brackets are influenced not just by team statistics, but also by fan emotions and regional loyalty. This project analyzes over 130,000 bracket submissions to uncover how geographic and emotional factors affect prediction behavior.

## Objective

To build an interactive analytics dashboard that:
- Detects regional favoritism and loyalty to home-state teams
- Highlights irrational trends in bracket choices
- Supports data-driven insights for marketing, fan engagement, and prediction optimization

## Data Overview

- Size: 130,000+ bracket entries
- Features: Team picks, round advancement, user geography, historical performance
- Sources: NCAA bracket archives and user submission data

## Key Insights

- Strong evidence of **home-state bias**, particularly in early rounds
- Overestimation of underdog success for local teams
- Specific regions displayed repeated irrational picks for teams with poor historical records
- Visual correlation between geographic proximity and pick frequency

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - Removed incomplete brackets and standardized team names
   - Merged with historical win/loss data for comparative analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Aggregated pick frequency by team, round, and user region
   - Identified deviations from statistically expected outcomes

3. **Behavioral Pattern Identification**:
   - Highlighted areas where emotional bias overrode logical prediction
   - Compared pick accuracy across regions

4. **Geographic Visualization**:
   - Created Tableau dashboards mapping pick trends by U.S. state
   - Emphasized areas with strongest local team favoritism

## Tools and Technologies

- Tableau (for interactive dashboards and maps)
- Excel and Python (for preprocessing and EDA)
- Behavioral Analytics
- Geographic Mapping
- Data Storytelling and Presentation

## Business Value

- Useful for sponsors and marketing teams to understand fan engagement patterns
- Insights can improve regional ad targeting during March Madness
- Helps sports platforms design better recommendation systems for casual fans
- Reveals human behavior biases in crowdsourced prediction environments

## Project Outcome

- Finalist in state-wide NCAA analytics challenge
- Secured **3rd Place** among all participating universities in Indiana
- Project praised for storytelling, insight clarity, and business relevance
